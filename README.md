# Xperia Labs AI - Maze of Mayhem Landing Page

## Setup Instructions

### Adding the Hero Image

To display the actual hero image instead of the placeholder:

1. Save your hero image as `maze-of-mayhem-hero.jpg` in the same directory as `index.html`
2. The image will automatically replace the placeholder when the page loads

### Current Files Structure
```
├── index.html          # Main landing page
├── styles.css          # All styling
├── script.js           # Interactive functionality
└── maze-of-mayhem-hero.jpg  # Hero image (add this file)
```

### Features
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Integrated Launchlist wishlist widget
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Modern cyberpunk aesthetic
- SEO-friendly structure

### Customization
- Update the Launchlist widget key in `index.html` if needed
- Modify colors in `styles.css` (search for `#00ff88` for the main accent color)

The page is ready to deploy once you add the hero image file!
